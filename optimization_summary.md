# Optimization and Debugging Summary

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Thread Pool for File Processing
- Replaced individual threads with a thread pool using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Limited the number of concurrent processing tasks to prevent resource exhaustion
- Improved thread lifecycle management with proper cleanup

### 2. Database Optimizations
- Added indexes to frequently queried fields:
  - `UserDocument.upload_time` for sorting
  - `UserDocument.status` for filtering
  - `UserDocument.is_split` for filtering
  - `UserDocument.parent_id` for relationship queries
  - `UserDocument.content_type` for filtering
  - `UserDocument.folder_id` for relationship queries
  - `Folder.name` for searching
  - `Folder.parent_id` for relationship queries
  - `Folder.created_at` for sorting
  - `Folder.folder_type` for filtering
- Implemented pagination in the document listing endpoint to limit query size
- Optimized N+1 query issues by pre-loading related data

### 3. File Handling Improvements
- Optimized file splitting logic to use less memory:
  - Improved text file splitting to process files in chunks
  - Enhanced binary file splitting with buffered I/O
  - Added smarter detection of file types that need splitting
- Implemented automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Added scheduled cleanup task to prevent disk space issues

### 4. Error Handling and Logging
- Enhanced error handling in file processing
- Added more detailed logging
- Improved exception handling in async tasks

### 5. API Performance
- Added pagination to API endpoints
- Implemented filtering options for document listing
- Optimized response structure

### 6. Code Modernization
- Updated deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` calls to use timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- Set maximum upload file size limit

## Performance Impact

These optimizations should result in:

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: By processing files in chunks and using buffered I/O
2. **Improved Concurrency**: By using a thread pool with controlled number of workers
3. **Faster Database Queries**: Through proper indexing and pagination
4. **Better Disk Space Management**: With automatic cleanup of temporary files
5. **More Responsive API**: Through optimized queries and pagination

## Future Recommendations

1. **Caching**: Implement Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data
2. **Database Migration**: Consider moving to a more robust database like PostgreSQL for larger deployments
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use Celery for more complex background tasks
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring tools to track system health
